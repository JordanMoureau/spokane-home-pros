          <p>
            As the seasons turn and Spokane finally thaws out, local homeowners
            are turning their attention to the great outdoors—specifically, how
            to make it <em>livable</em>. Outdoor living spaces have become more
            than patios and porches; they’re full-on extensions of the home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're working with a small backyard in Browne’s Addition or
            an acre out in Mead, Spokane homeowners are embracing bold new
            trends to bring comfort, functionality, and year-round usability to
            their outdoor spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Composite Decking that Can Handle Spokane Weather
          </h2>
          <p>
            Say goodbye to the constant sanding and staining. Composite decking
            is durable, low-maintenance, and built to handle Spokane’s snow,
            rain, and sizzling summers. Brands like Trex and TimberTech are
            especially popular with homeowners who want long-lasting curb
            appeal.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Covered Patios with Heaters & Lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            With unpredictable spring and fall weather, covered patios are the
            MVP. Add overhead heaters, built-in lighting, and even retractable
            shades for a space that’s cozy from March to November.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Outdoor Kitchens & Built-in Grills
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane homeowners are cooking up more than burgers these days. Full
            outdoor kitchens with built-in grills, prep space, mini-fridges, and
            even pizza ovens are taking center stage.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Stone countertops</li>
            <li>Weatherproof cabinetry</li>
            <li>Gas and charcoal grill combos</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Paver Patios with Creative Patterns
          </h2>
          <p>
            Classic concrete is out—colorful pavers in herringbone, basketweave,
            and custom mosaics are in. These patio styles not only add design
            flair but hold up beautifully through freeze/thaw cycles.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Ambient Lighting for Evening Vibes
          </h2>
          <p>
            From Edison string lights to built-in step lighting and lantern
            sconces, lighting sets the mood. Smart lighting systems with app
            control are becoming increasingly popular in Spokane neighborhoods.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Fire Features that Steal the Show
          </h2>
          <p>
            Whether it's a built-in fire pit or a dramatic fire table, Spokane
            homeowners want warmth and ambiance. Bonus: it extends your outdoor
            season by months.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Built-in Seating & Multi-Level Layouts
          </h2>
          <p>
            Built-in benches and multi-level decks or patios help divide space
            and add visual interest. It's perfect for entertaining groups—or
            creating separate zones for dining, relaxing, and hot tubbing.
          </p>

            Spokane homeowners are loving earthy greens, charcoal blues, and

            Planning a home remodel in Spokane? Choosing the right contractor
            can be the difference between a smooth experience and a renovation
            nightmare. Whether you're updating a single room or tackling a
            whole-home overhaul, having the right team makes all the difference.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Spokane Home Pros, we’ve worked with dozens of homeowners
            navigating the renovation process. Here’s our guide to hiring a
            remodeling contractor in Spokane that you can trust—with your
            budget, your vision, and your home.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Know What You Want
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before you reach out to any contractors, get clear on your project
            goals. Are you remodeling a bathroom? Expanding your kitchen?
            Finishing a basement? The more specific you can be, the better your
            contractor can estimate timelines and costs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Ask for Local Recommendations
          </h2>
          <p>
            Word of mouth goes a long way in Spokane. Ask neighbors, friends, or
            coworkers who they’ve used—and who they’d avoid. Sites like
            Nextdoor, Yelp, and Google Reviews can also give you a feel for
            who’s reliable (and who’s not).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Verify Licensing & Insurance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Your contractor should be licensed in Washington State and carry
            both liability and workers’ comp insurance. Don’t just take their
            word for it—ask for proof. This protects you from being held liable
            for accidents or damage on your property.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Review Past Work
          </h2>
          <p>
            A reputable contractor should have a portfolio of completed
            projects. Look for examples similar to your remodel scope. Bonus
            points if they’ve worked in neighborhoods like South Hill, Shadle
            Park, or Indian Trail—contractors familiar with Spokane’s unique
            housing stock can anticipate challenges better.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Get Multiple Bids
          </h2>
          <p>
            Don’t just go with the first estimate you receive. Get at least
            three bids to compare pricing, scope, and timelines. Remember: the
            cheapest bid isn’t always the best—look for value, not just price.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Ask the Right Questions
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Who will be on-site daily?</li>
            <li>How do you handle permitting?</li>
            <li>What’s your typical timeline for a project this size?</li>
            <li>How do you manage unexpected issues or change orders?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Review the Contract Carefully
          </h2>
          <p>
            A good contractor will provide a clear, detailed contract. Make sure
            it outlines the scope of work, payment schedule, timeline, and
            warranty information. Never work with a contractor who pressures you
            to skip the paperwork.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">

          <p>
            Outgrown your current home, but not ready to move? You’re not alone.
            Spokane homeowners are increasingly turning to custom home additions
            as a smart way to gain space, add value, and stay in the
            neighborhood they love.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether it’s a sunroom, a bonus room over the garage, or a full
            multi-room expansion, a home addition can completely transform your
            daily life. Here’s everything you need to know to plan a successful
            home addition in Spokane.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Common Home Addition Types in Spokane
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Master suite additions</li>
            <li>Kitchen expansions</li>
            <li>In-law suites or guest quarters</li>
            <li>Sunrooms and enclosed patios</li>
            <li>Garage conversions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Additions can be built out (expanding the footprint) or up (adding a
            second story or finishing an attic). Your lot size, zoning
            regulations, and budget will help determine what’s possible.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Planning & Permitting in Spokane
          </h2>
          <p>
            In Spokane, most home additions require permits and must follow
            local zoning guidelines. These include property setbacks, height
            restrictions, and rules for egress and energy efficiency. Working
            with a contractor familiar with Spokane’s permitting process can
            save you weeks of delays.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Average Cost of a Home Addition
          </h2>
          <p>
            Costs vary based on size, finishes, and structural changes. As a
            general rule, Spokane homeowners can expect to spend:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>$150–$250 per square foot</strong> for basic builds
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>$250–$400+ per square foot</strong> for high-end or
              complex additions
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Don’t forget to budget for design fees, permits, and potential
            temporary living arrangements if the build is disruptive.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. How Long Does a Home Addition Take?
          </h2>
          <p>
            On average, expect the full process to take{" "}
            <strong>3 to 6 months</strong>, from planning to final inspection:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>1–2 months: Design and permitting</li>
            <li>2–4 months: Construction</li>
            <li>
              1–2 weeks: Final walk-through, inspections, punch list items
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Weather and availability of subcontractors can impact your timeline,
            so always pad your expectations by a few weeks—especially during
            Spokane’s snowy months.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Should You Move or Add On?
          </h2>
          <p>
            With Spokane’s housing inventory still tight, many homeowners are
            finding that a thoughtful addition beats the cost and chaos of
            relocating. You stay rooted in your community and avoid the costs of
            selling, buying, and moving.
          </p>

      "You don’t need a massive budget to upgrade your bathroom. Spokane homeowners are modernizing with quick, affordable changes—from peel-and-stick flooring to refreshed fixtures and framed mirrors.",

        <div className=" leading-relaxed text-base space-y-6">
          <p>
            A full bathroom remodel can cost thousands—but that doesn’t mean you
            can’t refresh your space on a budget. Spokane homeowners are getting
            creative with small upgrades that make a big impact, whether they’re
            prepping to sell or just craving a little glow-up.
          </p>

          <p>
            From Riverside to Indian Trail, these cost-effective bathroom
            upgrades are helping local homeowners improve comfort, style, and
            function—without blowing up their budget.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Swap Out Your Vanity
          </h2>
          <p>
            A new vanity can completely change the vibe of your bathroom. Look
            for off-the-shelf options at stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s, or
            check local salvage yards and Facebook Marketplace for gently used
            pieces you can paint or refinish.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Refresh Fixtures for a Modern Look
          </h2>
          <p>
            Brushed gold, matte black, and warm champagne tones are trending in
            Spokane right now. Updating your faucet, showerhead, and cabinet
            pulls is a fast and affordable way to modernize your space.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Install Peel-and-Stick Flooring
          </h2>
          <p>
            Peel-and-stick vinyl tiles have come a long way. Choose patterns
            that mimic ceramic, wood, or even marble—and install it yourself in
            a weekend. Bonus: it’s waterproof and renter-friendly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Paint the Walls & the Tile (Yes, Really)
          </h2>
          <p>
            If your tile is in good shape but outdated, consider a tile-specific
            epoxy paint to update the color. Pair it with a fresh wall color to
            make your bathroom feel brand new for under $100.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Upgrade Lighting for Better Ambiance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Harsh overheads out, warm sconces and dimmable LED mirrors in.
            Lighting affects how you feel in a space—especially in a small
            bathroom—so this change makes a big difference.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Add Open Shelving or Wall Storage
          </h2>
          <p>
            Floating shelves, wall-mounted baskets, and ladder-style towel racks
            create function without sacrificing floor space. Perfect for older
            homes with tight layouts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Frame Your Mirror
          </h2>
          <p>
            That builder-grade mirror? Frame it with trim or a pre-made mirror
            frame kit. It’ll look custom—and cost you less than $50.
          </p>
