            What Are the Top 5 Must-Have Features for a Spokane Kitchen Remodel?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A successful Spokane kitchen remodel integrates features that
            enhance storage, durability, convenience, workspace, and ambiance.
            Below are the five core upgrades that transform any renovation into
            a functional, stylish centerpiece:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom cabinetry designed to maximize every inch of storage</li>
            <li>
              Premium countertops and backsplashes built for durability and
              visual impact
            </li>
            <li>
              Smart kitchen technologies that boost energy efficiency and
              convenience
            </li>
            <li>
              A versatile kitchen island that adds workspace, storage, and
              seating
            </li>
            <li>
              Layered lighting solutions for task, ambient, and accent
              illumination
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By prioritizing these five elements, you create a cohesive design
            framework that informs material selection and layout planning. Next,
            we’ll examine why custom cabinetry is foundational to Spokane
            kitchens.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Why Is Custom Cabinetry Crucial for Spokane Kitchens?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Custom cabinetry defines storage capacity and aesthetic cohesion in
            a Spokane kitchen by tailoring shelf heights, drawer widths, and
            finishes to local architectural styles. This bespoke approach
            optimizes pantry and utensil organization while reflecting
            Craftsman, modern farmhouse, or transitional design themes.
            Thoughtful cabinet layouts eliminate wasted corners and create a
            seamless visual flow, setting the stage for complementary surfaces
            and hardware in your remodel.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            How Do High-Quality Countertops and Backsplashes Improve Your
            Kitchen?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Durable countertops and backsplashes protect walls and work surfaces
            from heat, moisture, and stains, ensuring long-term performance in a
            busy Spokane household. Materials like quartz, granite, and Dekton
            resist scratches and bacterial growth, making food prep safer. At
            the same time, a striking backsplash lends visual character, tying
            together cabinetry, flooring, and fixtures for a polished, cohesive
            look.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            What Smart Kitchen Technologies Are Popular in Spokane Remodels?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Smart kitchen technologies—such as Wi-Fi-enabled ovens, touchscreen
            refrigerators, and app-controlled lighting—improve energy efficiency
            and simplify daily tasks. Voice-activated timers, remote temperature
            monitoring, and automated faucet controls reduce waste and support
            eco-friendly remodeling goals. Integrating these systems during
            construction ensures hidden wiring, streamlined interfaces, and full
            functionality from day one.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Why Is a Functional Kitchen Island a Must-Have Feature?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A well-designed kitchen island enhances workspace by providing a
            central prep zone, additional seating for social gatherings, and
            built-in storage like wine racks or pull-out bins. Whether you
            choose a waterfall edge countertop or a portable cart-style island,
            this freestanding focal point boosts both form and function in
            open-concept Spokane homes, creating a natural gathering spot for
            family and friends.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            How Does Optimized Lighting Enhance Spokane Kitchen Remodels?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Layered lighting—task fixtures over counters, ambient ceiling
            lights, and accent pendants—ensures your Spokane kitchen is bright
            for cooking and inviting for entertaining. Energy-efficient LEDs
            under cabinets maintain consistent illumination without glare, while
            dimmable overhead fixtures set the mood. Strategic lighting design
            highlights architectural details and improves safety by eliminating
            shadows in work zones.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these top upgrades defined, let’s explore how custom cabinetry
            maximizes storage and organization in Spokane kitchens.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            How Can Custom Cabinetry Maximize Storage and Organization in
            Spokane Kitchens?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Custom cabinetry in Spokane kitchens tailors every shelf and drawer
            to your storage needs, combining design flexibility with durable
            craftsmanship. By specifying cabinet heights, depths, and internal
            configurations, you unlock hidden storage opportunities that
            accommodate small appliances, specialty cookware, and pantry staples
            in homes where square footage can be limited. This foundation of
            organized cabinetry ensures other remodel elements, like islands and
            countertops, integrate seamlessly.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            What Are the Benefits of Pull-Out Pantries and Vertical Storage?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Pull-out pantries and vertical storage solutions convert narrow gaps
            into accessible shelving, making it easy to reach spices, canned
            goods, or baking supplies. These systems:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Utilize deep cabinet cavities without sacrificing visibility
            </li>
            <li>Prevent items from getting buried in back corners</li>
            <li>
              Simplify inventory management by presenting contents at eye level
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Maximized vertical storage fosters a more efficient workflow and
            supports a clutter-free countertop.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Which Cabinetry Styles and Materials Suit Spokane Homes Best?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane kitchens often feature styles that reflect Pacific Northwest
            character—warm woods, clean lines, and natural textures. Popular
            choices include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shaker-style maple: Offers a timeless, transitional look</li>
            <li>
              Painted oak: Introduces color accents while showcasing grain
            </li>
            <li>
              Plywood with veneer finish: Provides moisture resistance and
              stability
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each material pairs well with local flooring and accent pieces,
            reinforcing an authentic regional aesthetic.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            How Do Soft-Close Hinges and Custom Features Improve Functionality?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Soft-close hinges and drawer slides enhance everyday convenience by
            preventing slam-shut noise and reducing wear on cabinetry. Custom
            features like integrated utensil trays, under-cabinet lighting
            channels, and built-in charging stations further elevate
            functionality. These details showcase quality craftsmanship and
            underscore the value of investing in tailored storage solutions
            before moving on to surface selections.

            What Are the Best Countertop and Backsplash Materials for Spokane
            Kitchen Remodels?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Selecting the right countertop and backsplash materials is essential
            to balance durability, maintenance, and style in your Spokane
            kitchen renovation. The ideal surfaces resist staining, withstand
            daily wear, and complement local design motifs such as natural stone
            accents or minimalist palettes. Understanding the performance
            characteristics of each option helps homeowners choose the solution
            that aligns with their lifestyle.

            Quartz, granite, and Dekton are popular countertop materials, each
            with distinct properties. Quartz is known for its non-porous nature
            and stain resistance, while granite offers unique veining. Dekton
            excels in heat and scratch resistance, making it a durable option
            for busy kitchens.
          </p>

          </p>
          <ul>

            How Do Countertops and Backsplashes Affect Kitchen Value?
          </h2>

            High-quality surfaces significantly enhance resale value by
            attracting buyers who appreciate durable, low-maintenance materials.
            Well-installed countertops and backsplashes can recoup 70–80% of
            their cost in home value, especially when paired with complementary
            cabinetry and fixtures. This ROI factor underscores the importance
            of selecting premium surfaces as part of a comprehensive Spokane
            kitchen renovation strategy.

            Integrating smart technologies during a Spokane kitchen remodel
            future-proofs your space, enhances sustainability, and streamlines
            everyday tasks. By planning electrical and network infrastructure
            early, you ensure appliances, fixtures, and controls operate
            seamlessly. Smart upgrades contribute to energy savings and support
            modern living standards.

            enter eco modes during off-peak hours, aligning with Spokane’s green
            building initiatives.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            How Does a Kitchen Island Enhance Spokane Kitchen Remodels?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A kitchen island serves as a multifunctional centerpiece in Spokane
            remodels, adding prep space, casual dining, and extra storage in one
            architectural feature. By customizing size, shape, and
            amenities—such as integrated sinks or wine coolers—you create a
            dynamic focal point that supports both cooking and entertaining.
            Planning island placement ensures optimal traffic flow and visual
            harmony.

          <p>
            Islands with overhangs accommodate bar stools, transforming the
            space into a social hub. Beneath the countertop, built-in drawers,
            cabinets, and wine racks maximize storage. This dual-function design
            keeps frequently used items within reach and invites guests to
            gather, bridging cooking areas with living zones.

            How to Integrate a Kitchen Island into Your Spokane Kitchen Design?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Effective integration begins with measuring clearances and traffic
            patterns to maintain at least 42 inches around all sides. Selecting
            a countertop material that contrasts or complements the main
            counters adds visual interest. Coordinating island lighting—such as
            pendant fixtures—anchors the feature and ties it back to ambient and
            task illumination schemes.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            Why Is Optimized Lighting Essential for Spokane Kitchen Remodels?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Optimized lighting enriches Spokane kitchen remodels by combining
            functionality with mood-setting effects. Properly layered light
            ensures safe cooking, highlights design details, and enhances the
            overall ambiance. A strategic lighting plan considers fixture
            placement, bulb type, and control options to create a flexible
            environment that adapts to daily routines and special occasions.

            How Does LED and Under-Cabinet Lighting Improve Kitchen Spaces?
          </h2>
          <p>
            LED lighting under cabinets casts consistent, shadow-free light onto
            countertops, improving visibility for chopping and prep work. LEDs
            consume up to 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs and have a
            longer lifespan, reducing maintenance and operational costs. Their
            low heat output also preserves countertop finishes and materials.

            <li>Pair black-metal pendants with industrial-modern kitchens</li>

          <p>
            Outgrowing your home doesn't have to mean moving out. In Spokane,
            adding on to your existing space is often a smarter (and more
            affordable) way to get the room you need—without saying goodbye to
            the neighborhood you love.
          </p>

            Whether it's a new bedroom, expanded kitchen, home office, or
            multi-room addition, Spokane Home Pros connects homeowners with

            code.

            1. Plan Around Function
          </h2>
          <p>
            Start by identifying your biggest pain points. Need a guest suite? A
            bigger family room? More space for work or hobbies? Clarifying how
            you’ll use the space will shape the layout and design from day one.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            2. Consider Property Lines & Permits
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane County has specific zoning and building requirements—like
            setbacks, height restrictions, and total square footage caps. A good
            contractor will help you navigate the permitting process and ensure
            your addition is fully compliant.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            3. Tie It Into the Existing Structure
          </h2>
          <p>
            A well-done addition should feel like it’s always been part of your
            home. That means matching rooflines, exterior finishes, and interior
            materials wherever possible. Seamless design = higher resale value.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            4. Think Long-Term ROI
          </h2>
          <p>
            Room additions in Spokane typically cost $150–$300 per square foot,
            depending on size and finish level. But if done right, they can
            offer huge returns in daily comfort—and resale value down the road.

            Work with a pro to create a layout that fits your lot, lifestyle,
            and budget—and avoids costly mid-build changes.

            1. Decide How You’ll Use the Space

            lighting.

            2. Moisture Matters—Big Time
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane’s wet winters and spring melts mean waterproofing is a must.
            We always inspect for existing leaks or moisture problems before
            finishing begins—and recommend sump pumps, drainage solutions, or
            sealing as needed.

            A finished basement should feel like the rest of your home—not a
            chilly afterthought. Proper insulation, subfloor systems, and zoning

            A good <strong>kitchen remodeling</strong> plan blends form and
            function—so you’re not just upgrading looks, but making the space
            work for your life.

            2. Prioritize Flow and Lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest upgrades we see in Spokane homes is improving
            traffic flow and natural light. Knock down a wall. Widen a walkway.
            Add task lighting or a bigger window above the sink.
          </p>
          <p>
            These small structural changes can have a huge impact on comfort and
            usability—especially in older homes throughout the{" "}
            <strong>Spokane area</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            3. Invest in Quality Materials
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sure, that off-brand cabinet deal online looks good… until it warps
            after one winter. In the Pacific Northwest, moisture and temperature
            shifts matter. We always recommend choosing{" "}
            <strong>high quality</strong>, durable materials that will stand up
            to real family life.

            We work closely with local suppliers to ensure your kitchen isn’t
            just beautiful—it’s built to last.

            4. Don’t Skip the Small Stuff
          </h2>
          <p>
            Drawer organizers. Pull-out shelves. That one cabinet no one can
            ever reach? These are the details that transform a remodel from
            “nice” to <strong>custom home remodeling Spokane</strong>–level

        <div className=" leading-relaxed text-base space-y-6">
          <p>
            As the seasons turn and Spokane finally thaws out, local homeowners
            are turning their attention to the great outdoors—specifically, how
            to make it <em>livable</em>. Outdoor living spaces have become more
            than patios and porches; they’re full-on extensions of the home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're working with a small backyard in Browne’s Addition or
            an acre out in Mead, Spokane homeowners are embracing bold new
            trends to bring comfort, functionality, and year-round usability to
            their outdoor spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Composite Decking that Can Handle Spokane Weather
          </h2>
          <p>
            Say goodbye to the constant sanding and staining. Composite decking
            is durable, low-maintenance, and built to handle Spokane’s snow,
            rain, and sizzling summers. Brands like Trex and TimberTech are
            especially popular with homeowners who want long-lasting curb
            appeal.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Covered Patios with Heaters & Lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            With unpredictable spring and fall weather, covered patios are the
            MVP. Add overhead heaters, built-in lighting, and even retractable
            shades for a space that’s cozy from March to November.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Outdoor Kitchens & Built-in Grills
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane homeowners are cooking up more than burgers these days. Full
            outdoor kitchens with built-in grills, prep space, mini-fridges, and
            even pizza ovens are taking center stage.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Stone countertops</li>
            <li>Weatherproof cabinetry</li>
            <li>Gas and charcoal grill combos</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Paver Patios with Creative Patterns
          </h2>
          <p>
            Classic concrete is out—colorful pavers in herringbone, basketweave,
            and custom mosaics are in. These patio styles not only add design
            flair but hold up beautifully through freeze/thaw cycles.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Ambient Lighting for Evening Vibes
          </h2>
          <p>
            From Edison string lights to built-in step lighting and lantern
            sconces, lighting sets the mood. Smart lighting systems with app
            control are becoming increasingly popular in Spokane neighborhoods.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Fire Features that Steal the Show
          </h2>
          <p>
            Whether it's a built-in fire pit or a dramatic fire table, Spokane
            homeowners want warmth and ambiance. Bonus: it extends your outdoor
            season by months.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Built-in Seating & Multi-Level Layouts
          </h2>
          <p>
            Built-in benches and multi-level decks or patios help divide space
            and add visual interest. It's perfect for entertaining groups—or
            creating separate zones for dining, relaxing, and hot tubbing.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            Thinking About Upgrading Your Outdoor Space?
          </h2>

            Planning a home remodel in Spokane? Choosing the right contractor
            can be the difference between a smooth experience and a renovation
            nightmare. Whether you're updating a single room or tackling a
            whole-home overhaul, having the right team makes all the difference.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Spokane Home Pros, we’ve worked with dozens of homeowners
            navigating the renovation process. Here’s our guide to hiring a
            remodeling contractor in Spokane that you can trust—with your
            budget, your vision, and your home.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Know What You Want
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before you reach out to any contractors, get clear on your project
            goals. Are you remodeling a bathroom? Expanding your kitchen?
            Finishing a basement? The more specific you can be, the better your
            contractor can estimate timelines and costs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Ask for Local Recommendations
          </h2>
          <p>
            Word of mouth goes a long way in Spokane. Ask neighbors, friends, or
            coworkers who they’ve used—and who they’d avoid. Sites like
            Nextdoor, Yelp, and Google Reviews can also give you a feel for
            who’s reliable (and who’s not).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Verify Licensing & Insurance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Your contractor should be licensed in Washington State and carry
            both liability and workers’ comp insurance. Don’t just take their
            word for it—ask for proof. This protects you from being held liable
            for accidents or damage on your property.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Review Past Work
          </h2>
          <p>
            A reputable contractor should have a portfolio of completed
            projects. Look for examples similar to your remodel scope. Bonus
            points if they’ve worked in neighborhoods like South Hill, Shadle
            Park, or Indian Trail—contractors familiar with Spokane’s unique
            housing stock can anticipate challenges better.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Get Multiple Bids
          </h2>
          <p>
            Don’t just go with the first estimate you receive. Get at least
            three bids to compare pricing, scope, and timelines. Remember: the
            cheapest bid isn’t always the best—look for value, not just price.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Ask the Right Questions
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Who will be on-site daily?</li>
            <li>How do you handle permitting?</li>
            <li>What’s your typical timeline for a project this size?</li>
            <li>How do you manage unexpected issues or change orders?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Review the Contract Carefully
          </h2>
          <p>
            A good contractor will provide a clear, detailed contract. Make sure
            it outlines the scope of work, payment schedule, timeline, and
            warranty information. Never work with a contractor who pressures you
            to skip the paperwork.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">

        <div className=" leading-relaxed text-base space-y-6">
          <p>
            Outgrown your current home, but not ready to move? You’re not alone.
            Spokane homeowners are increasingly turning to custom home additions
            as a smart way to gain space, add value, and stay in the
            neighborhood they love.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether it’s a sunroom, a bonus room over the garage, or a full
            multi-room expansion, a home addition can completely transform your
            daily life. Here’s everything you need to know to plan a successful
            home addition in Spokane.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Common Home Addition Types in Spokane
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Master suite additions</li>
            <li>Kitchen expansions</li>
            <li>In-law suites or guest quarters</li>
            <li>Sunrooms and enclosed patios</li>
            <li>Garage conversions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Additions can be built out (expanding the footprint) or up (adding a
            second story or finishing an attic). Your lot size, zoning
            regulations, and budget will help determine what’s possible.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Planning & Permitting in Spokane
          </h2>
          <p>
            In Spokane, most home additions require permits and must follow
            local zoning guidelines. These include property setbacks, height
            restrictions, and rules for egress and energy efficiency. Working
            with a contractor familiar with Spokane’s permitting process can
            save you weeks of delays.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Average Cost of a Home Addition
          </h2>
          <p>
            Costs vary based on size, finishes, and structural changes. As a
            general rule, Spokane homeowners can expect to spend:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>$150–$250 per square foot</strong> for basic builds
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>$250–$400+ per square foot</strong> for high-end or
              complex additions
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Don’t forget to budget for design fees, permits, and potential
            temporary living arrangements if the build is disruptive.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. How Long Does a Home Addition Take?
          </h2>
          <p>
            On average, expect the full process to take{" "}
            <strong>3 to 6 months</strong>, from planning to final inspection:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>1–2 months: Design and permitting</li>
            <li>2–4 months: Construction</li>
            <li>
              1–2 weeks: Final walk-through, inspections, punch list items
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Weather and availability of subcontractors can impact your timeline,
            so always pad your expectations by a few weeks—especially during
            Spokane’s snowy months.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Should You Move or Add On?
          </h2>
          <p>
            With Spokane’s housing inventory still tight, many homeowners are
            finding that a thoughtful addition beats the cost and chaos of
            relocating. You stay rooted in your community and avoid the costs of
            selling, buying, and moving.
          </p>

        <div className=" leading-relaxed text-base space-y-6">
          <p>
            A full bathroom remodel can cost thousands—but that doesn’t mean you
            can’t refresh your space on a budget. Spokane homeowners are getting
            creative with small upgrades that make a big impact, whether they’re
            prepping to sell or just craving a little glow-up.
          </p>

          <p>
            From Riverside to Indian Trail, these cost-effective bathroom
            upgrades are helping local homeowners improve comfort, style, and
            function—without blowing up their budget.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Swap Out Your Vanity
          </h2>
          <p>
            A new vanity can completely change the vibe of your bathroom. Look
            for off-the-shelf options at stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s, or
            check local salvage yards and Facebook Marketplace for gently used
            pieces you can paint or refinish.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Refresh Fixtures for a Modern Look
          </h2>
          <p>
            Brushed gold, matte black, and warm champagne tones are trending in
            Spokane right now. Updating your faucet, showerhead, and cabinet
            pulls is a fast and affordable way to modernize your space.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Install Peel-and-Stick Flooring
          </h2>
          <p>
            Peel-and-stick vinyl tiles have come a long way. Choose patterns
            that mimic ceramic, wood, or even marble—and install it yourself in
            a weekend. Bonus: it’s waterproof and renter-friendly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Paint the Walls & the Tile (Yes, Really)
          </h2>
          <p>
            If your tile is in good shape but outdated, consider a tile-specific
            epoxy paint to update the color. Pair it with a fresh wall color to
            make your bathroom feel brand new for under $100.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Upgrade Lighting for Better Ambiance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Harsh overheads out, warm sconces and dimmable LED mirrors in.
            Lighting affects how you feel in a space—especially in a small
            bathroom—so this change makes a big difference.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Add Open Shelving or Wall Storage
          </h2>
          <p>
            Floating shelves, wall-mounted baskets, and ladder-style towel racks
            create function without sacrificing floor space. Perfect for older
            homes with tight layouts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Frame Your Mirror
          </h2>
          <p>
            That builder-grade mirror? Frame it with trim or a pre-made mirror
            frame kit. It’ll look custom—and cost you less than $50.
          </p>
