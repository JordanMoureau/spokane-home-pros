          <p>
            Outgrowing your home doesn't have to mean moving out. In Spokane,
            adding on to your existing space is often a smarter (and more
            affordable) way to get the room you need—without saying goodbye to
            the neighborhood you love.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether it's a new bedroom, expanded kitchen, home office, or
            multi-room addition, Spokane Home Pros connects homeowners with
            expert contractors who know how to build right—on budget, and up to
            code.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            1. Plan Around Function
          </h2>
          <p>
            Start by identifying your biggest pain points. Need a guest suite? A
            bigger family room? More space for work or hobbies? Clarifying how
            you’ll use the space will shape the layout and design from day one.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            2. Consider Property Lines & Permits
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane County has specific zoning and building requirements—like
            setbacks, height restrictions, and total square footage caps. A good
            contractor will help you navigate the permitting process and ensure
            your addition is fully compliant.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            3. Tie It Into the Existing Structure
          </h2>
          <p>
            A well-done addition should feel like it’s always been part of your
            home. That means matching rooflines, exterior finishes, and interior
            materials wherever possible. Seamless design = higher resale value.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            4. Think Long-Term ROI
          </h2>
          <p>
            Room additions in Spokane typically cost $150–$300 per square foot,
            depending on size and finish level. But if done right, they can
            offer huge returns in daily comfort—and resale value down the road.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            5. Don’t Skip the Design Phase
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before hammers swing, detailed plans save time, money, and stress.
            Work with a pro to create a layout that fits your lot, lifestyle,
            and budget—and avoids costly mid-build changes.
          </p>

        <div className="leading-relaxed text-base space-y-6">
          <p>
            An unfinished basement is a goldmine of potential. Whether you're
            dreaming of a guest suite, a home office, or the ultimate hangout
            zone, finishing your basement can add serious value and square
            footage to your <strong>Spokane home</strong>—without the cost of a
            full addition.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Spokane Home Pros, we’ve helped countless homeowners transform
            cold, concrete spaces into warm, inviting lower levels. Here’s what
            you need to know before diving into your{" "}
            <strong>basement finishing Spokane</strong> project.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            1. Decide How You’ll Use the Space
          </h2>
          <p>
            Will it be a media room? A rental unit? A home gym? Knowing the
            purpose of your basement will guide everything from layout to
            lighting.
          </p>
          <p>Spokane families often choose:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Guest bedrooms with egress windows</li>
            <li>Playrooms and teen lounges</li>
            <li>Basement home offices</li>
            <li>Game rooms and bars</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            2. Moisture Matters—Big Time
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane’s wet winters and spring melts mean waterproofing is a must.
            We always inspect for existing leaks or moisture problems before
            finishing begins—and recommend sump pumps, drainage solutions, or
            sealing as needed.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            3. Insulation & Comfort
          </h2>
          <p>
            A finished basement should feel like the rest of your home—not a
            chilly afterthought. Proper insulation, subfloor systems, and zoning
            for HVAC go a long way in making the space livable year-round.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            4. Permits & Code Compliance
          </h2>
          <p>
            All finished basements in Spokane must meet local building codes,
            especially for ceiling height, emergency egress, electrical, and
            ventilation. Our team handles permits and inspections so you don’t
            have to stress.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            5. Don’t Forget Storage
          </h2>
          <p>
            Smart basement design balances open living areas with hidden
            storage. Think built-in closets, under-stair shelving, and
            mechanical room access without making things feel cluttered.

          <p>
            If your Spokane kitchen is feeling outdated, cramped, or just
            doesn’t spark joy anymore, a remodel might be the perfect solution.
            At Spokane Home Pros, we specialize in{" "}
            <strong>kitchen remodeling Spokane</strong> homeowners trust to

          <p>
            But how do you make sure your kitchen remodel is actually worth the
            investment? Here are our top expert tips to help Spokane homeowners
            get the most from their <strong>remodeling project</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            1. Start with a Plan—Not a Pinterest Board
          </h2>
          <p>
            We get it—you’ve been dreaming of a white quartz waterfall island.
            But before jumping into materials, think about how you actually use
            your kitchen. Do you host family holidays? Need more counter space
            for meal prep? Hate how the fridge is across the room from
            everything else?
          </p>
          <p>
            A good <strong>kitchen remodeling</strong> plan blends form and
            function—so you’re not just upgrading looks, but making the space
            work for your life.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            2. Prioritize Flow and Lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest upgrades we see in Spokane homes is improving
            traffic flow and natural light. Knock down a wall. Widen a walkway.
            Add task lighting or a bigger window above the sink.
          </p>
          <p>
            These small structural changes can have a huge impact on comfort and
            usability—especially in older homes throughout the{" "}
            <strong>Spokane area</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            3. Invest in Quality Materials
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sure, that off-brand cabinet deal online looks good… until it warps
            after one winter. In the Pacific Northwest, moisture and temperature
            shifts matter. We always recommend choosing{" "}
            <strong>high quality</strong>, durable materials that will stand up
            to real family life.

            We work closely with local suppliers to ensure your kitchen isn’t
            just beautiful—it’s built to last.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
            4. Don’t Skip the Small Stuff
          </h2>
          <p>
            Drawer organizers. Pull-out shelves. That one cabinet no one can
            ever reach? These are the details that transform a remodel from
            “nice” to <strong>custom home remodeling Spokane</strong>–level

          <p>
            As the seasons turn and Spokane finally thaws out, local homeowners
            are turning their attention to the great outdoors—specifically, how
            to make it <em>livable</em>. Outdoor living spaces have become more
            than patios and porches; they’re full-on extensions of the home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're working with a small backyard in Browne’s Addition or
            an acre out in Mead, Spokane homeowners are embracing bold new
            trends to bring comfort, functionality, and year-round usability to
            their outdoor spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Composite Decking that Can Handle Spokane Weather
          </h2>
          <p>
            Say goodbye to the constant sanding and staining. Composite decking
            is durable, low-maintenance, and built to handle Spokane’s snow,
            rain, and sizzling summers. Brands like Trex and TimberTech are
            especially popular with homeowners who want long-lasting curb
            appeal.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Covered Patios with Heaters & Lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            With unpredictable spring and fall weather, covered patios are the
            MVP. Add overhead heaters, built-in lighting, and even retractable
            shades for a space that’s cozy from March to November.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Outdoor Kitchens & Built-in Grills
          </h2>
          <p>
            Spokane homeowners are cooking up more than burgers these days. Full
            outdoor kitchens with built-in grills, prep space, mini-fridges, and
            even pizza ovens are taking center stage.

          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Paver Patios with Creative Patterns
          </h2>
          <p>
            Classic concrete is out—colorful pavers in herringbone, basketweave,
            and custom mosaics are in. These patio styles not only add design
            flair but hold up beautifully through freeze/thaw cycles.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Ambient Lighting for Evening Vibes
          </h2>
          <p>
            From Edison string lights to built-in step lighting and lantern
            sconces, lighting sets the mood. Smart lighting systems with app
            control are becoming increasingly popular in Spokane neighborhoods.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Fire Features that Steal the Show
          </h2>
          <p>
            Whether it's a built-in fire pit or a dramatic fire table, Spokane
            homeowners want warmth and ambiance. Bonus: it extends your outdoor
            season by months.

            Planning a home remodel in Spokane? Choosing the right contractor
            can be the difference between a smooth experience and a renovation
            nightmare. Whether you're updating a single room or tackling a
            whole-home overhaul, having the right team makes all the difference.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Spokane Home Pros, we’ve worked with dozens of homeowners
            navigating the renovation process. Here’s our guide to hiring a
            remodeling contractor in Spokane that you can trust—with your
            budget, your vision, and your home.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Know What You Want
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before you reach out to any contractors, get clear on your project
            goals. Are you remodeling a bathroom? Expanding your kitchen?
            Finishing a basement? The more specific you can be, the better your
            contractor can estimate timelines and costs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Ask for Local Recommendations
          </h2>
          <p>
            Word of mouth goes a long way in Spokane. Ask neighbors, friends, or
            coworkers who they’ve used—and who they’d avoid. Sites like
            Nextdoor, Yelp, and Google Reviews can also give you a feel for
            who’s reliable (and who’s not).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Verify Licensing & Insurance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Your contractor should be licensed in Washington State and carry
            both liability and workers’ comp insurance. Don’t just take their
            word for it—ask for proof. This protects you from being held liable
            for accidents or damage on your property.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Review Past Work
          </h2>
          <p>
            A reputable contractor should have a portfolio of completed
            projects. Look for examples similar to your remodel scope. Bonus
            points if they’ve worked in neighborhoods like South Hill, Shadle
            Park, or Indian Trail—contractors familiar with Spokane’s unique
            housing stock can anticipate challenges better.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Get Multiple Bids
          </h2>
          <p>
            Don’t just go with the first estimate you receive. Get at least
            three bids to compare pricing, scope, and timelines. Remember: the
            cheapest bid isn’t always the best—look for value, not just price.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Ask the Right Questions
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Who will be on-site daily?</li>
            <li>How do you handle permitting?</li>
            <li>What’s your typical timeline for a project this size?</li>
            <li>How do you manage unexpected issues or change orders?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Review the Contract Carefully
          </h2>
          <p>
            A good contractor will provide a clear, detailed contract. Make sure
            it outlines the scope of work, payment schedule, timeline, and
            warranty information. Never work with a contractor who pressures you
            to skip the paperwork.

            Outgrown your current home, but not ready to move? You’re not alone.
            Spokane homeowners are increasingly turning to custom home additions

            neighborhood they love.

            <li>Garage conversions</li>

          <p>
            Additions can be built out (expanding the footprint) or up (adding a
            second story or finishing an attic). Your lot size, zoning
            regulations, and budget will help determine what’s possible.

            2. Planning & Permitting in Spokane
          </h2>
          <p>
            In Spokane, most home additions require permits and must follow
            local zoning guidelines. These include property setbacks, height
            restrictions, and rules for egress and energy efficiency. Working
            with a contractor familiar with Spokane’s permitting process can
            save you weeks of delays.

          <p>
            Costs vary based on size, finishes, and structural changes. As a
            general rule, Spokane homeowners can expect to spend:

            <li>

          </ul>

          <p>
            Don’t forget to budget for design fees, permits, and potential
            temporary living arrangements if the build is disruptive.

            4. How Long Does a Home Addition Take?
          </h2>
          <p>
            On average, expect the full process to take{" "}
            <strong>3 to 6 months</strong>, from planning to final inspection:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
            <li>1–2 months: Design and permitting</li>
            <li>2–4 months: Construction</li>
            <li>
              1–2 weeks: Final walk-through, inspections, punch list items
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Weather and availability of subcontractors can impact your timeline,
            so always pad your expectations by a few weeks—especially during
            Spokane’s snowy months.

          </h2>
          <p>
            With Spokane’s housing inventory still tight, many homeowners are
            finding that a thoughtful addition beats the cost and chaos of
            relocating. You stay rooted in your community and avoid the costs of
            selling, buying, and moving.

          <p>
            A full bathroom remodel can cost thousands—but that doesn’t mean you
            can’t refresh your space on a budget. Spokane homeowners are getting
            creative with small upgrades that make a big impact, whether they’re
            prepping to sell or just craving a little glow-up.
          </p>

          <p>
            From Riverside to Indian Trail, these cost-effective bathroom
            upgrades are helping local homeowners improve comfort, style, and
            function—without blowing up their budget.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            1. Swap Out Your Vanity
          </h2>
          <p>
            A new vanity can completely change the vibe of your bathroom. Look
            for off-the-shelf options at stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s, or
            check local salvage yards and Facebook Marketplace for gently used
            pieces you can paint or refinish.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            2. Refresh Fixtures for a Modern Look
          </h2>
          <p>
            Brushed gold, matte black, and warm champagne tones are trending in
            Spokane right now. Updating your faucet, showerhead, and cabinet
            pulls is a fast and affordable way to modernize your space.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            3. Install Peel-and-Stick Flooring
          </h2>
          <p>
            Peel-and-stick vinyl tiles have come a long way. Choose patterns
            that mimic ceramic, wood, or even marble—and install it yourself in
            a weekend. Bonus: it’s waterproof and renter-friendly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            4. Paint the Walls & the Tile (Yes, Really)
          </h2>
          <p>
            If your tile is in good shape but outdated, consider a tile-specific
            epoxy paint to update the color. Pair it with a fresh wall color to
            make your bathroom feel brand new for under $100.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            5. Upgrade Lighting for Better Ambiance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Harsh overheads out, warm sconces and dimmable LED mirrors in.
            Lighting affects how you feel in a space—especially in a small
            bathroom—so this change makes a big difference.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            6. Add Open Shelving or Wall Storage
          </h2>
          <p>
            Floating shelves, wall-mounted baskets, and ladder-style towel racks
            create function without sacrificing floor space. Perfect for older
            homes with tight layouts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 ">
            7. Frame Your Mirror
          </h2>
          <p>
            That builder-grade mirror? Frame it with trim or a pre-made mirror
            frame kit. It’ll look custom—and cost you less than $50.
          </p>
